# Week3_LSE_data_analytics

Modules to be explored 
Youâ€™ll explore a range of topics organised into six modules. As you work through the topics, you may face the same challenges and discoveries as your peers. For this reason, it's best to work through the content synchronously during the time allocated for each module, along with your peers, to gain optimal support from the Career Accelerator community. Additionally, the facilitator-led feedback will be most relevant to the content during the time allocated for that given module. You will, however, have the opportunity to work slightly ahead if you wish to follow your own schedule. The content will be published every two weeks. The module topics are:

Module 1
Introduction to Python programming 
Module 2
Getting started with Pandas
Module 3
Data wrangling with Pandas
Module 4
Data visualisation with Python
Module 5
Data scraping with Python
Module 6
Making recommendations to the business
