Module 3: Data wrangling with Pandas!
Data handling, often composed of data ingestion and data wrangling, is usually one of the most time-consuming tasks in data analysis. We can only move on to what many consider the most rewarding part of data analysis once data handling is performed well and the data is accurate: analysing and presenting results. Skipping necessary data handling steps can result in significant errors, missed opportunities, and erroneous analyses.

Data wrangling, also known as data manipulation, is when the data is transformed and mapped from a ‘raw’ format into a format that's appropriate for data analysis. The main aim of data wrangling is to assure data quality and usefulness. Therefore, data wrangling forms part of the ‘Clean and explore the data’ step in the data analytics process.

Learning outcomes
Throughout the module, you’ll learn to:

*combine data using concat() and merge() to join columns and rows in a DataFrame
*explore the groupby() mechanics in Python to group data and perform better analysis
*explore data aggregation on the created groupby() objects for efficient computations
*wrangle data using Pandas
*write functions to transform and clean data by using apply()
*use Python objects and functions for splitting, applying, and combining data
*use anonymous functions and Lambda.
